        When the temperature drops at football games, out come the big jackets
        and the hand warmers. Sometimes, things can get too hot too fast.

    <p>
      As the divisional round of the N.F.L. playoffs begins on Saturday, the
      teams with the highly coveted home-field advantage will enjoy all the
      typical luxuries of playing at home, including sleeping in their own beds
      and the promise of loud fans cheering for them. The teams that play in
      colder climates — including Kansas City, Philadelphia and Buffalo — have
      another advantage: knowing not to stand near the sideline heaters for too
      long.
      <br />
      <br />
      “You have layers of stuff on, so you can’t really feel the direct heat,
      but then you smell something,” said Ike Boettger, an offensive lineman for
      the Bills. “You just smell that burning cloth smell and you know that
      somebody got a little too close.”
      <br /><br />
      When the temperature drops late in the N.F.L. season, minor sideline fires
      and singed skin have become rites of passages. For some players, the smell
      of burned cotton, the sight of melted cleats and the occasional seared
      body part are synonymous with winter football.
      <br /><br />
      “I mean, if you didn’t do that, you didn’t play football in cold weather,”
      said Scott Chandler, a retired tight end who spent nearly five seasons
      with the Bills after starting his N.F.L. career in sunny San Diego. “Just
      like little kids find out by touching the stove that it’s hot, you got to
      learn the same way as football players.”

      The fires extend past the players. Last January, a Falcons public
      relations staff member, Gaby Moran, was on the sideline for a game against
      the Bills in Orchard Park, N.Y. With windy conditions and snow in the air,
      and the temperature in the 20s, another Falcons employee yelled to Moran
      that she had caught on fire.
      <br /><br />
      Moran said she looked down to find the bottom of her jacket ablaze,
      ignited by the giant heater she had been standing near to stay warm. “We
      just started patting the bottom,” Moran said. “I completely forgot to
      stop, drop and roll.” A trail of feathers from her damaged jacket flew as
      she ran to the locker room to fetch a new one.
